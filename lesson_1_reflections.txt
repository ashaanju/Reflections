How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Helped find differences fast
Needed to focus on only few lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Follow thought process easily
Find out how the code evolved
Can go back to any point and redo 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros:
Changes are meaningful
Versions likely to compile
Control the versions being saved

Cons:
If forgetful, might lose work if does not save
Too many versions
Versions might not make sense

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is meant for code. The files are often interlinked
The files in other systems are not always interlinked

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives history of the commit on the files
That helps us identify versions and the changes 
git diff helps us compare differences between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It will make me more confident
I will know that I can return to the most recent error free version easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 Work on my latest project
